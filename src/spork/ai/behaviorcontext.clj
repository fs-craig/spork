;;Integration functions for a spork simulation context where entity
;;behavior is controlled by spork.ai behavior trees, and entities are
;;stored in a spork.entitysystem.store entity store.

;;This was originally prototyped in an actual simulation, and as
;;the implementation solidified, it's been moved to a general,
;;portable namespace for reuse.
(ns spork.ai.behaviorcontext
  (:require [spork.ai.core            :as ai]
            [spork.ai.behavior        :as b]
            [spork.entitysystem.store :as store]
            [spork.sim.simcontext     :as sim]
            [spork.util.record        :as record]))

;;Implementation of an evaluation context for entity behaviors.
;;Specifically, we capture the current entity behing "updated" via its
;;behavior, the target behavior (as in spork.ai.behavior or
;;compatible), some message state, and other relevant context -
;;currently the spork.sim.simcontext simulation context/entitystore,
;;the current message being processed - if any - the time of update,
;;elapsed time delta, and any state data associated with the entity.
;;Some of these are captured as references via atoms, and are amenable
;;to side-effecting updates during evaluation.

;;Since it acts as a map (via defrecord) the behavior environment
;;allows us to add or update additional "lexical vars" for use in the
;;evaluation of behavior functions by associng things onto the
;;environment.  This works nicely with the behavior function (befn)
;;idiom, which when coupled with map destructuring, allows us to
;;define which "bindings" from the behavior environment the behavior
;;function cares about, and to trivially modify the environment for
;;other "downstream" behavior evaluation.  The end result is that the
;;behavior environment acts as a state accumulator, and as a
;;blackboard for communicating information across behaviors - all in a
;;data-driven and idiomatic manner with "optional" side-effects.
