;;entities are message handlers.
;;We can view them as functions that handle messages (events) just
;;like any other event handler; If the entity has a behavior, then
;;the behavior is incorporated into the message handling.
;;Specifically, we have to create a behavior context to eval the
;;entity's message handling in.
;;This means, there's a trivial wrapper function for handling
;;generic entity messages (Even for complex behavior-driven
;;ents), that is :: ctx -> msg -> entity -> ctx
;;That's basically what step! does.


;;as it stands, we may have overstep our current state.
;;so, we'd like to wire this into the commit behavior somehow.
;;this is equivalent to our roll-forward behavior, where we
;;continue bevaling, until we get a behavior that intersects
;;with the current time.  Our typical medium for governing
;;this process is to use the messages, and to return the
;;time remaining as a part of the context.  If the step
;;was incomplete, we can evaluate another step from the
;;outside, using the leftover message from the context.

;;this is on the hot path, so we'll optimize it.

;;really, this is assoc-in using dispatched types.
;;If we make some guarantees about the underlying data
;;structure, namely that it's composed of places, we
;;can get something useful out of it.
;;Namely, places don't change (i.e. they always exist
;;as long as the container exists).

;;Places can be nested paths into objects.

;;commit entities in a context.
;;Know what the next time on the schedule is.

;;can we compose simulators?
