;;Delta Diffing and Compressed Simulation History Serialization
;;=============================================================

;;Another useful feature...
;;We'd like to optionally audit our project, when we create a stream and
;;initialize it.
;;We can do this by hooking into the table-xforms, since this allows us
;;to audit.

;;serializing all the snapshots is untenable...
;;can we compute diffs?
;;All we really care about, as we traverse forward,
;;is information regarding who changed...
;;So if any entity was touched or updated during the
;;t, the it'll show...
;;In theory, any last-updates to entities
;;will show up....so that limits our diffs
;;to the entities with last-update components..
;;From there, we can just compare them with their previous selves...

;;The goal here is to easily serialize our entity database...
;;Note...we have some options for how we do this...
;;We could do an initial state + diffs (similar to
;;git...) and save our stuff that way.  For now we
;;have a stream of state snapshots which have internal
;;references via persistent structures....so...
;;we should? be able to persist our stuff efficiently.
;;We're going to stream this rather than do it all in
;;memory...we can also add a diff buffer that can
;;be serialized at the end of the day...
;;So, anytime an entity is modified (via gete adde
;;assoce, etc.), the diff buffer (or dirty flag)
;;gets mutated in the db.  Then we compare dirty
;;entities with their previous versions to see
;;what the differences are...seems plausible...
;;the brute-force approach is to just use
;;hashing to compare...assuming we have hash
;;equality, we just hash-compare the stores, and
;;then the components in the stores, and then
;;the entities...
;;probably makes more sense to diff the components...
;;structural diffing is a pretty powerful way to
;;compute deltas...and laid back.  It "would" be
;;nice if we'd cached the values though.

                         (conj acc lk) acc) (conj acc lk))) [] lcomps))))
