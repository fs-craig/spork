;;Providing Common Access to the State in the Simulation Context
;;==============================================================

;;The simulation context contains the simulation state - a large
;;nested map of information that is 'typically' partitioned by a
;;particular domain.  Some systems, like the fill function, need
;;access to multiple domains to fulfill their purpose.  In response,
;;we maintain an open, broad structure for the state portion of the
;;context, but provide a set of common paths or mappings to resources
;;embedded in the state. 

;;As a result, subsystems can query resources by predefined paths - a
;;higher level of abstraction and clarity - OR they may dip down to
;;low level operations on the raw state.

;;This should maintain a balance between flexibility and clarity.

;;Common Paths to Simulation Resources
;;====================================

;;In the previous implementation, the 'state' was implemented as a
;;class, with concrete members to access each piece.  We retain that
;;level of commonality via the paths, but the underlying
;;representation is based on a dynamic map structure, so we can still
;;add new data as needed in a flexible manner.

;;For instance, the following example creates a set of accessors for
;;our simulation state.  This allows us to dissect our nested map of
;;state a bit easier.  Each symbol in the defpath binding returns a
;;function that, given a simulation context, points to the named
;;resource using standard clojure map operations via
;;clojure.core/get-in.
